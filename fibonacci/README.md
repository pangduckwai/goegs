# The Fibonacci Sequence

## Scenario
> The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of integers in which the value of each item is the sum of the 2 previous values.

> Typically starting with 1 and 2, the first 7 values are 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21.

> Giving 0 and 1 as the first 2 values, write a loop to find the first 30 values of the Fibonacci sequence.
